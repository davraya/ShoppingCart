# Overview

This is a shopping cart program in C++ which shows the following elements of the language:
  * Variables
  * Loops
  * Functions
  * Classes
  * Maps
  * Pointers
  * Iterators
  
C++ is one of the most widely used low level languages. It is consider high performance, but
also a little more difficult to use.

In this program I programed a shoping cart to which the client is able to add as many items as he or she wants to. The client is also able to see the details of the 
items in his or her cart along with a total price of all the items in the cart. For simplicity reasons taxes are ommited. 

I started this small project to become more familiar with C++ and CLion. Hopefully it helps someone to learn a little bit as well.

# Development Environment
* IDE : CLion
* Language : C++
* Version Control System : Git

 

# Useful Websites
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/)
* [cplusplus](https://cplusplus.com/)

# Future Work
* Add a couple conditionals and use some boolean logic to make it error safe. Some try catch should be good enough for that as well.
